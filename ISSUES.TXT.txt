1. NETWORK PLAYER VEHICLE NEEDS TO BE FINALIZED AT LOBBY SO IT DOES NOT GIVE
EMPY NODE NAME ERROR IN LEVEL.

IF ASSIGNMENT MUST BE IN LEVEL, THEN DO SET NAME TO BE THE NAME OF CEHICLE.

BUT I RECOMMEND AGAINST IT. JUST LIKE HUMAN PLAYER IS FINALIZED IN LKOBBY,
NETWORK PLAYER MUST TOO, SNE DHIS WHOLE DATA IN LOBBY OR IN NETWORK-PLAYER SCRIPT.

E 0:00:40:0902   network_player.gd:12 @ update_variables(): Condition "name.is_empty()" is true.
  <C++ Source>   scene/main/node.cpp:1159 @ set_name()
  <Stack Trace>  network_player.gd:12 @ update_variables()
				 network_player.gd:7 @ _process()



THE ABOVE ISSUE IS SOLVED CHEAPLY BY ASSIGNING TO DATA IN player.gd script

2. MAKE LOBBY EFFICIENTLY AS DATA DOES NOT FLOW TO SERVER IN LOBBY

INSTEAD, IT IS JUST BEING PULLED FROM SERVER USING GET REQUEST.

SO MAKE A MECHIANISM TO PUSH ROOM DATA TO SERVER WHENEVER EVENT OCCURS

JUST LIKE ADDING PLAYER OR STARTING GAME EVENTS PUSH DATA TO SERVER.
