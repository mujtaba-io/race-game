1. network players are not being instanced in other players scenes
not in lobby, not in level..

it means that somehow this data is not going from data['players'] to other parts of game



ISNT IT BETTER TO DIERCTLY SEND/RCV ROOM.PLAYERS TO / FRO SERVER
THIS WILL SAVE HEADACHE OF data[''] things/???


and will make code sooooooooooooo simple.....



AND DESIGN SERVER TO JUSR RELAY AND SYNC IT SOMEHOW....
