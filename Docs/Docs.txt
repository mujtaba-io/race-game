CODE CONVENTION:
	
	1. Starting from underscore (_) is private thing.
	2. ClassNames, SceneNames, ScriptNames, FolderNames follow PascalCase
	3. All variables, objects use snake_case

STRUCTURE:
	1. AssetManager must register all Levels & Vehicles to appear in menus.
	2. Global is AutoLoad Singleton that carries all transition variables.


NOTES:
	
	Level expects all players to be sent, laps to be told, ... etc all data
	to be sent beforehand. It must only add_child() them at appropriate
	locations.
