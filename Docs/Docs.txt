CODE CONVENTION:
	
	1. Starting from underscore (_) is private thing.
	2. ClassNames, SceneNames, ScriptNames, FolderNames follow PascalCase
	3. All variables, objects use snake_case

STRUCTURE:
	
	0. All dependencies are top-to-bottom. Lower nodes only provide methods
	that are called by upper methods. There are no two-sided dependencides.
	Lower modules are totally independent of upper modules.
	For example:
		Level has Players have Vehicle
		Players also have UI
		Level has UI
	
	1. AssetManager must register all Levels & Vehicles to appear in menus.


NOTES:
	
	Level expects all players to be sent, laps to be told, ... etc all data
	to be sent beforehand. It must only add_child() them at appropriate
	locations.
